## Assignment 1 Questions

### Question 1
You have a certain type of chicken wire to build a temporary enclosure for holding a chicken 
in your backyard. You have 100m chicken wire and want to maximise the enclosure area for 
your given materials. 
(a) You plan to build a triangular enclosure (the lengths of three sides are x, y, and z, 
respectively. See Figure 1
Suppose x is 10m longer than y, find the lengths of the three sides x, y, and z. 
- Construct a one-dimensional optimisation model and solve it using the Golden 
Section Search method. Solution details and MATLAB codes are required.
(15 marks)
- Construct a two-dimensional optimisation model and solve it using the Lagrange 
multiplier method. Solution details are required (no MATLAB code required).
(10 marks)

(b) If it is a right-angled triangular enclosure, the longest side is known to be 41.4m, please 
find the two sides (x, y) using the Linear Programming (LP) method. 
- Please construct an optimisation model and solve it using MATLAB function 
linprog(). Solution details and MATLAB codes are required.
(20 marks)

### Question 2
Suppose a linear equation is to be fit predicting raw material price as a linear function of the 
number of product A and product B (made of the same raw material) sold given the following 
data:

% [[Price of raw material] [Quantity of product A sold] [Quantity of product B sold]]

[5 9 1;
2 13 8;
9 17 3;
4 10 9;
6 15 2;
10 8 5];

Assume the prediction equation is
$y_i = c_0 +c_1 \cdot x_{1i} + c_2 \cdot x_{2i}$
, where $c_1 c_2$ are the prediction parameters on the quantity of products A and B sold,
respectively, and c_0 is the intercept. 
Define $x_{1i}, x_{2i}$ as the observations on the quantity of products A and B sold, respectively, and 
$y_i$ as the observed price. $i$ identifies the $i^{th}$ observation

(a) Suppose the desired criterion for equation fit is that the fitted data exhibit a minimum of 
the largest absolute deviation between the raw material price and its prediction.
Please construct an LP model to minimise the largest absolute deviation.
- Write down the tabular form of the formed LP problem. Explain the steps to get to the 
final tabular form. 
(20 marks)
- Solve the formed LP problem using the MATLAB function-linprog(); explain the result.
(10 marks)


(b) Suppose the desired criteria for equation fit is that the fitted data exhibit a minimum sum 
of the squared deviations between the raw material price and its prediction. You are then 
asked to solve the formed least square (LS) problem. 
- Write down the linear system equation (Ax=B) of the LS problem.
(15 marks)
- Solve the LS problem using the normal equations approach.
(10 marks)


## Assignment 2

### Question 1
There is a signal b collected at M sampling points(b(1), b(2), ‚Ä¶b(m), ‚Ä¶,b(M)), and 
you are asked to strategically place N components x (x(1), x(2), ‚Ä¶,x(n),‚Ä¶x(N)) into 
the system to modify the signal profile. The modified signal profile is expressed as 
B=Ax+b.
The matrix A and vector b are stored in files: A.mat and b.mat, and in Matlab, you 
can access the data as follows: load A; load b.
You are asked to implement the following tasks:

Q1(a): 
Use the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique to find x (consider low-rank 
approximation r=200).
Based on your SVD results, find the condition number of A.
(Note- SVD can be calculated by Matlab built-in function).

Q1(b): 
Use the regularisation approach (regularised linear least squares) to find x.
Select different regularisation parameters ùúÜ = $1e^{-10},1e^{-9},1e^{-8},1e^{-7},1e^{-6}, 1e^{-5}, 1e^{-4}, 1e^{-3}, 1e^{-2}$
Plot an L-curve figure that shows the relationship between 2-norm(x) and 2-norm(Ax-b) with different regularisation parameters.
(Note ‚Äì refer to lecture notes (LA9, Least square problems).

Q1(c): 
The signal B will satisfy the following condition: |ùêÅ ‚àí ùêÅùüé| ‚â§ ùêÅùüé ‚àà, where, ùë©ùüé is the 
mean value of B. And ‚àà (ùëö) = $1ùëí^{-4}$, ùëö=1,2,‚Ä¶M. In addition, b and B are both 
positive vectors. The range of components x: 0‚â§x(n) ‚â§ $5ùëí^{‚àí3}$, n=1,2,‚Ä¶,N.
Write a Matlab code to minimise the 1-norm of vector x. 
Note: please consider the function linprog() in Matlab; 

### Question 2 
Assessment Type: Application
Task Description:
The student needs to prepare a presentation (ppt file (at least ten slides) + audio 
recording file) on real-world applications that use concepts learned in the linear 
algebra (LA) part.
The presentation should contain the following sections 
(1) introduction; 
(2) theory/methods; 
(3) results and discussion/interpretation;
(4) conclusion and 
(5) reference.
